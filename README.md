Look at fMRI data measuring the brainâ€™s responses to visual images. This data is provided by the Gallant Lab at UC Berkeley

Subject is shown pictures of everyday objects, such as a baby, stars, etc. This is the input. Each picture is a 128 pixel by 128 pixel gray scale image, which can be represented by a vector of length 128*128 =16384.

Goal is to predict how brain reacts to visual stimulus
